## BLKNODE - A Blokus Clone written in Node.js

Manipulate (change) your pieces to fit onto a grid occupied by three other players.  There are only two rules:
1. Your pieces must touch a corner of another of your pieces (or your assigned corner of the grid to start).
2. Your pieces must not touch the face of your other pieces.  They can touch the face of other players' pieces.

That's it!  Claim the most squares to win.  Get an extra 5 points if the last piece is the single square.

## How to Play

BLKNODE is a four player online game.  This means you will need to wait for three other players to start.  You can also open four windows to try it out.  

Once the players have joined, players take turns placing tiles on the board.  Rotate and flip the pieces to place them on the board.

When you are out of space to place pieces, or you give up, press "Pass".  This will end your turn, and you will not be given another turn.  When everyone passes, the game is over.  The player with the highest score wins.

This game was made in a day, and made awesome in a week.  Our team met at the Microsoft Node Hackathon.
